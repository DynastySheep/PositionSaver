# Position Saver v0.1

This script lets you create and save positions on your map, allowing you to change the color, sprite and scale of the blip. It also has bookmark system that will help you organise your blips. I don't really know a good use case for this apart from marking stuff like stunt jumps, collectibles or frequent drug dealer spots perhaps.. or just some cool places that you find.

## Useful notes:
- It doesn't work for interiors
- You can use quick teleport to quickly scroll between saved positions
- Bookmarks will help you organise your blips, use them!
- All the positions data is stored in Lua Scripts/store/positions_data.lua 

## Future updates:
- Bookmark settings for changing blips in the given bookmark(changing all blip color/scale/sprite at once)
- More intuitive UI (need help with moving the Settings menu below everything else)
- More sprites!
- Add support for interiors (if possible?)
- Suggestions?
