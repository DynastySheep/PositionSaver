# Position Saver v0.1

This script lets you create and save positions on your map, allowing you to change the color, sprite and scale of the blip. It also has bookmark system that will help you organise your blips. I don't really know a good use case for this apart from marking stuff like stunt jumps, collectibles or frequent drug dealer spots perhaps.. or just some cool places that you find.

## Useful notes:
- It doesn't work for interiors
- You can use quick teleport to quickly scroll between saved positions
- Includes blip groups to help you organise your blips
- Can change to different blip sprites, colours, scale for 1 blip and also for groups
- Default settings for blip spawning

## Future updates:
- More intuitive UI (need help with moving the Settings menu below everything else)
- Probably more sprites if suggested. I tried to limit sprites to the ones that are rarely used in freemode, to avoid blending in with existing ones
- Add support for interiors (if possible?)
- Suggestions?
